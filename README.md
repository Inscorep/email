# Email

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.2.

## Data Endpoint
https://fun-app-sa-inscorep.azurewebsites.net/api/emails?code=pVKbInrPv3LOasejCUoULNj%2F8VNdgleY3W4h6B3HO7I2DRBFWG1KDQ%3D%3D

We decided to only have one data endpoint containing everything for the different sections to simplify things. 
You may hit the endpoint wherever needed to extract the relevant data.

## Data Structure
- account
  - accountName
  - inbox
  - sent

## Task
- create an email client interface
- list of accountNames
  - inbox
  - sent

By selecting an account the relative data should be displayed.

All can be done with or without a css framework.
